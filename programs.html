            <h4>Food For Change</h4>
            <p>The Houston Soup Kitchen is at the forefront of efforts by food banks to use food as a catalyst – in partnership with social 
                service programs – to help individuals achieve their life goals.<br>
                An essential aspect of the Food for Change strategy is the use of data to study outcomes in two focus areas: health-related 
                and economic opportunities.
