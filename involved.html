            <h4>Give Funds</h4>
            <p>Every $1 provides a full day of meals to our neighbors in need. Give someone their next meal. Right now, one in five people in 
                southeast Texas don’t have enough to eat. Your gift will help provide food and hope to children, families and seniors facing 
                food insecurity in our community.

            <h4>Give Food</h4>
            <p>Food donations from industry partners and community food drives are critical to helping us provide food for children, families and 
                seniors. When you make a food donation, you’ll be providing food for better lives for our neighbors in Southeast Texas.

            <h4>Give Time</h4>
            <p>We are actively recruiting volunteers to help us move our fresh and nutritious food into the hands of our neighbors in need. You can 
                volunteer individually or as a group in a team-building station. Our volunteer stations range from packing boxes in our Senior Box 
                Program, to bagging fresh produce in our Food Sourcing station to restocking the shelves in our Emergency Food Pantry, located in the 
                Houston Soup Kitchen Resource Center.

            <h4>Give Your Voice</h4>
            <p>A strong nutrition safety net is essential to a future where no one goes hungry. Houston Soup Kitchen advocates for policies that protect 
                individuals and families from hunger. <br> 
                <br>Raise your voice and let your elected officials know that you support hunger-relief programs by taking action now!
